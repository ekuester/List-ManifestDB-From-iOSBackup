# List-ManifestDB-From-iOSBackup
Read and extract files from iOS backup made by iTunes

see what is covered under the hood of iOS

Program for parsing the Backup files of iOS generated by iTunes for iPad and iPhone

The file Manifest.mbdb describes no longer the backup files for iOS. From iTunes version 12.5 (or so) the main information for the files is stored in a SQLite database Manifest.db. iTunes of macOS Sierra is using this scheme in any case.

The structure of this database is as follows

$ sqlite3

sqlite> .open Manifest.db

sqlite> .fullschema

CREATE TABLE Files (fileID TEXT PRIMARY KEY, domain TEXT, relativePath TEXT, flags INTEGER, file BLOB);

CREATE INDEX FilesDomainIdx ON Files(domain);

CREATE INDEX FilesRelativePathIdx ON Files(relativePath);

CREATE INDEX FilesFlagsIdx ON Files(flags);

CREATE TABLE Properties (key TEXT PRIMARY KEY, value BLOB);

.quit


Use the program for extracting of stored files which could not be recoverd otherwise.
Much of the code from the older program to decode Manifest.mbdb was recycled ;-)

Access to SQLite relies on <https://gist.github.com/zgchurch/3bac5443f6b3f407fe65>

Disclaimer: Use the program for what purpose you like, but hold in mind, that I will not be responsible for any harm it will cause to your hard- or software. It was your decision to use this piece of software.
